**REVIEW HIGH-LEVEL – Evaluation of my initial implementation**

==== - General problems of the application ====

All tasks 1 - 5 were written in a single `main.py` file
There is no separation into modules (data generation, cleaning, SQL, API, dashboard).
There is no clear flow: the code runs in order, dependencies mix together.
Uvicorn is started inside a script that already executes prints, resulting in freezes and unpredictable behavior.
The dashboard is generated in Python, not from the API → does not respect the requirements.

--- + What I should have done ---

Separate the code into multiple files for easy maintenance and a clean, structured workflow

* `build_data.py` → generation & validation
* `analytics_polars.py` → analytical logic
* `app.py` → FastAPI API
* `index.html` → JS dashboard
* `trades.db` → SQLite database


==== - Initial problems in Task 1 – Load & Explore Data ====

* I created Date & Time, then manually merged them which resulted in a complicated process that did not fully follow the requirement
* I used Pandas and Polars in parallel which complicated the code without reason.
* I did not introduce invalid data to clean later (0, -10, INVALID etc.).
* I did not create an ID column for the table so I could easily track each row

--- + What I should have done ---

* Generate data using a single method that includes all columns with the correct data types
* Generate also non-conforming data in order to remove it later in the cleaning stage
* Create the data creation logic in another file to maintain the structure of the application
* Create an ID that is sorted by TimeStamp to simulate real situations and easily track the data (as a linking column)


==== - Initial problems in Task 2 – Data Cleaning ====

* `dropna()` was applied on Pandas inside a loop → you lose valid data.
* BUY/SELL validation was checked on the entire dataset, not just the Side column.
* Anomalies were detected by iterating per column
* Non-conforming data was not displayed

--- + What I should have done ---

* Use a more efficient and more stable structure for data cleaning
* Display ID + invalid values in reporting
* Clearly structure the issues (missing, invalid_qty, invalid_price etc.)


==== - Initial problems in Task 3 – SQL Analytics ===

* You populated the Trades table incorrectly, without using “;” at the end, which results in errors and the table not being populated
* The net_position calculation was wrong, the Buy and Sell columns do not exist

--- + What I should have done ---

* Create a separate file for the code that handles SQL queries
* Write SQL code without errors


==== - Initial problems in Task 4 – API FastAPI ===

* Endpoints returned functions, not results. The functions ended with “print()” which is not correct for HTML output
* FastAPI was run inside the long script, which caused freezes.

--- + What I should have done ---

* Create the API separately
* “/api/summary” must return clean JSON from the DB
* “/api/trend/{symbol}” must return real data
* The JS dashboard must call the API, not Python


==== - Initial problems in Task 5 – Dashboard ===

* Plotly was launched with “pie.show()” which opens a local window, not a web view.
* No static HTML existed.
* The API was not used.
* No interactivity.
* The website did not run properly

--- + What I should have done ---

* Create an HTML file for the website
* Create the connection with the data correctly
* Use Chart.js for interactive dashboards
